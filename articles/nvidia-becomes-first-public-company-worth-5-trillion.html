The achievement occurred on Wednesday morning as shares surged by up to 5 percent, climbing to over $211.</p><p>This surge continues a remarkable growth trajectory for the company, which had just surpassed the $4 trillion mark in July. The consistent rise is attributed to sustained optimism about Nvidia's future global sales and its critical role in the AI sector. Following this milestone, Apple now sits at a $4 trillion market cap, with Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta trailing behind.</p><p>The chipmaker's valuation has soared by more than 50% in 2025, after an explosive 174% increase in 2024. This ascent highlights the immense demand for its GPUs, which are fundamental to powering data centres and AI applications worldwide.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-green"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2216028442.jpg?w=1024" alt="Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gestures during a presentation, with the Nvidia logo in the background." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">AI Dominance</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">Nvidia's strategic focus on AI has propelled its market value to unprecedented heights.</div></div><p><strong>Nvidia's rapid expansion</strong> reflects a broader trend of tech giants growing ever larger, but its specialisation in AI hardware has set it apart. The company's technology is not just a component but the very backbone of the current AI-driven economy, a fact not lost on investors.</p><div class="magazine-pullquote">"Nvidia hitting a $5 trillion market cap is more than a milestone; it's a statement, as Nvidia has gone from chip maker to industry creator."</div><p>The company's journey from a graphics card manufacturer to an AI powerhouse has been swift and decisive. Founded in 1993, its invention of the GPU laid the groundwork for modern visual and AI computing, and its fabless manufacturing model has allowed it to focus on design and innovation.</p><p>This focus has resulted in a commanding lead in the semiconductor industry, significantly widening the gap with competitors. The insatiable appetite for AI has helped tech stocks double the return of the broader market over the past three years.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-green"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/23/multimedia/23nvidia-01-wvgl/23nvidia-01-wvgl-superJumbo.jpg" alt="A close-up of an Nvidia GPU, showcasing its complex circuitry and design." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">The Engine of AI</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">Nvidia's advanced GPUs are the core components powering the global AI revolution.</div></div><p>Looking ahead, Nvidia's position appears secure, with CEO Jensen Huang expecting $500 billion in GPU sales by the end of 2026.
