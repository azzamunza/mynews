This finding comes from a new benchmark designed to test AI's real-world economic capabilities.</p><p>The benchmark, known as The Remote Labor Index, was developed by researchers at data annotation company Scale AI in collaboration with the Center for AI Safety (CAIS), a nonprofit organisation. It is designed to measure the ability of frontier AI models to automate economically valuable work by assigning them a variety of simulated freelance tasks.</p><p>The study involved giving several leading AI agents a range of these tasks to complete. The results were stark: the top-performing AI model could only complete less than 3 percent of the assigned work, indicating a significant gap between current AI capabilities and the requirements of autonomous professional work.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-indigo"><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/690147a56a37037ce5efc6db/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/A-%20Lab-AI-Agents-Tried-to-Make-Money-Doing-Freelance-Work-Business-2168056998.jpg" alt="An abstract digital illustration representing artificial intelligence and data flows." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">AI's Economic Value</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">Researchers are developing new benchmarks to test the practical ability of AI agents in the modern workforce.</div></div><p><strong>Financially, the AI agents fell dramatically short.</strong> Out of a potential earning pool of $143,991 available across all tasks, the most capable AI agent managed to earn only $1,810. This outcome highlights the complexities and nuances of freelance work that AI is not yet equipped to handle, such as client communication, subjective feedback, and creative problem-solving.</p><div class="magazine-pullquote">"Even the best could perform less than 3 percent of the work, earning $1,810 out of a possible $143,991."</div><p>These findings suggest that while AI is a powerful tool for specific, well-defined tasks, its ability to operate as an autonomous freelance worker is still in its infancy. The idea of AI agents replacing human professionals on a large scale remains a distant prospect, according to this research.</p><p>The study underscores the importance of focusing on AI as a tool to augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. The path to fully autonomous AI in the workplace requires significant advancements in reasoning, adaptability, and understanding of complex human instructions.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container" style="height: auto; background: #000;"><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz5wx5Fhc8U" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Exploring AI Capabilities"></iframe></div></div><div class="magazine-caption">Visual demonstrations of AI agents attempting complex tasks provide further context on their current limitations.</div></div></div><div class="magazine-sidebar"><div class="magazine-sidebar-image magazine-image-gradient-indigo"><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/690147a56a37037ce5efc6db/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/A-%20Lab-AI-Agents-Tried-to-Make-Money-Doing-Freelance-Work-Business-2168056998.jpg" alt="A square image with abstract AI-related graphics." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-sidebar-image-text">Benchmarking AI</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">The Remote Labor Index puts AI to the test in a real-world setting.</div><div class="magazine-sidebar-box"><h3>By The Numbers</h3><div class="magazine-stat-item"><div class="magazine-stat-number">&lt;3%</div><div class="magazine-stat-label">Work completed by the best AI agent</div></div><div class="magazine-stat-item"><div class="magazine-stat-number">$1,810</div><div class="magazine-stat-label">Amount earned by the top AI agent</div></div><div class="magazine-stat-item"><div class="magazine-stat-number">$143,991</div><div class="magazine-stat-label">Total potential earnings available</div></div></div><div class="magazine-sidebar-box"><h3>Key Context</h3><p>The Remote Labor Index is a new benchmark created by Scale AI and the Center for AI Safety (CAIS).
