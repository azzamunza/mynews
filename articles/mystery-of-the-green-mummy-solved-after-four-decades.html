Discovered in Bologna, Italy, in 1987, the body puzzled scientists, but recent studies show a post-mortem chemical reaction with its copper coffin is responsible for the startling preservation and colour.</p><p>The adolescent, dated to have died between 1617 and 1814, was buried in a copper-alloy casket which cracked over time. Fluids from the body reacted with the metal, creating copper corrosion products that infiltrated the remains. This process, known as ionic substitution, systematically replaced calcium in the bones with copper ions, tinting the tissues green and aiding in their preservation.</p><p>This case represents the most complete example of copper-induced mummification ever recorded, offering significant insights into how burial materials can interact with human remains. While copper's antimicrobial properties are known to inhibit decay, this discovery demonstrates a deeper level of tissue and bone penetration.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-green"><img src="https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/field/image/GreenMummy.jpg?itok=fWB0EnF0" alt="The green-coloured mummified remains of the teenager, showing the unusual preservation and hue." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">A Chemical Transformation</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">The remains were discovered in a copper-alloy coffin, which led to a unique chemical reaction causing the green colouration.</div></div><p><strong>Detailed analysis revealed that copper levels in some bones were several hundred times higher than average.</strong> The preservation was also aided by the cool, low-oxygen environment of the basement where the mummy was found. Interestingly, the left leg retained a more natural colour, likely because its position prevented direct contact with the corroding copper.</p><div class="magazine-pullquote">&quot;This completely changes our point of view on the role of heavy metals, as their effects on preservation are more complex than we might expect.&quot;</div><p>Researchers used advanced techniques like Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy to understand the chemical process. Their findings help archaeologists better interpret burial practices and the complex post-mortem changes that can occur in ancient remains. The cause of the teenager's death remains unknown, as no signs of trauma or disease were found.</p><p>The study highlights a fascinating and rare preservation phenomenon. It stands in contrast to more intentional forms of mummification, such as those in ancient Egypt, by showcasing a unique, accidental process driven by the burial environment and materials.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-teal"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Mummy_child_Bologna.jpg/800px-Mummy_child_Bologna.jpg" alt="A view of the mummified child in Bologna, highlighting the state of preservation." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">A Unique Case Study</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">The Bologna mummy provides an unprecedented look at copper-induced preservation.</div></div><p>This discovery provides a valuable case study for understanding taphonomy&mdash;the study of how organisms decay and become fossilised.

The discovery provides crucial data for archaeologists studying burial customs of the European elite during this period.</p></div></div></div><div class="magazine-bottom-section"><div class="magazine-full-width-image magazine-image-gradient-purple"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1200 800'><defs><linearGradient id='g' x1='0%' y1='0%' x2='100%' y2='100%'><stop offset='0%' style='stop-color:darkslategray;stop-opacity:1'/><stop offset='100%' style='stop-color:teal;stop-opacity:1'/></linearGradient></defs><rect width='1200' height='800' fill='url(%23g)'/><text x='50%' y='50%' font-family='Arial,sans-serif' font-size='48' font-weight='bold' fill='white' text-anchor='middle' dy='.3em'>ARCHAEOLOGICAL MYSTERY</text></svg>" alt="An abstract design representing the intersection of history and science." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text" style="font-size: 32px;">A New Chapter in Preservation Science</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">The Green Mummy of Bologna has rewritten our understanding of how metals in burial sites can lead to extraordinary forms of preservation.</div></div></div>
