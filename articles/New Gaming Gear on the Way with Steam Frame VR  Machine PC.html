        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div class="magazine-content">
            <p class="lead-paragraph">Valve, the company behind the popular Steam Deck, has announced a significant expansion of its hardware line-up, with three new devices scheduled for release in 2026. The new products include the Steam Frame VR headset, a powerful Steam Machine PC, and an updated Steam Controller, signalling a major push to bring the Steam ecosystem to more parts of the gaming landscape.</p>
            
            <p>Following the success of the Steam Deck in popularising portable PC gaming, Valve is now targeting the living room and virtual reality. The new Steam Machine is a compact, cube-shaped PC designed to be plugged into a television. It reportedly boasts performance six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, featuring a semi-custom AMD chip, 16GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most ambitious new product is the Steam Frame, a standalone virtual reality headset. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and runs on SteamOS, much like the Steam Deck. The headset features two 2160x2160 LCDs, inside-out tracking cameras, and eye tracking, positioning it as a direct competitor to devices like the Meta Quest 3. It will also support PCVR gaming through a wireless adapter.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">"Gaming on the go was just the start of Valve&#8217;s push to make Steam used in more places. A PC is on the way, as is a controller and a neat portable VR headset."</blockquote>


            <p>The new hardware is designed to create a unified gaming ecosystem. To complement the new devices, Valve is also releasing an updated Steam Controller, which includes trackpads below magnetic control sticks. This suite of products aims to make PC gaming more accessible and versatile, whether on the go, in the living room, or in virtual reality.</p>
            
            <p>While specific launch dates and pricing are yet to be announced, Valve has confirmed that Australia will be among the launch regions in early 2026. The company plans to share more details after the new year, leaving gamers to speculate on how the new hardware will be positioned in the competitive console and VR markets.</p>
