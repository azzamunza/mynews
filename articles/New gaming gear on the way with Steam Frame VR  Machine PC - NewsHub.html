                        <p class="magazine-lead-text">Valve appears set to release new hardware for gamers, following new brand registrations that hint at what may be coming. A recent filing points to ‘Steam Frame’ as a potential new virtual reality headset, while another for a ‘Steam Machine PC’ suggests a revived effort in the PC console space.</p>
                        <p>The new trademark filings indicate Valve is actively developing a successor to its original, less successful Steam Machines from 2015. Those devices were PCs from various manufacturers that ran on Valve's own SteamOS. The company's hardware ambitions have seen recent success with the popular handheld Steam Deck, showing a renewed focus on delivering powerful gaming hardware.</p>

                            <div class="magazine-caption">The success of the Steam Deck has renewed interest in Valve's hardware projects.</div>
                        </div>

                        <p><strong>A New Push into VR</strong> Speculation is growing that ‘Steam Frame’ could be a standalone VR headset designed to compete directly with established players like the Meta Quest 3. This move would signify a major new initiative by Valve to capture a larger share of the immersive gaming market, leveraging its extensive Steam library.</p>

                        <p>The original Steam Machines saw limited success, but Valve's hardware ambitions continued with the well-received Steam Deck, proving the company can deliver compelling gaming devices. Gamers are now speculating that these new devices could be officially announced at an upcoming gaming conference, with a potential release in early 2026.</p>

                        <div class="magazine-pullquote">"We’ve been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play."</div>

                        <p>The 'Steam Frame' is rumoured to be a streaming-first, wireless VR headset that can play a user's entire Steam library, including non-VR titles. It may also feature advanced technologies like foveated streaming to optimise performance. This approach could make high-end PC VR more accessible without being tethered by cables.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, the new Steam Machine is expected to be a console-like PC designed for the living room, significantly more powerful than the Steam Deck. It aims to provide a seamless way to play the entire Steam library on a television, directly competing with traditional consoles like the PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

                        <p>With these potential new products, Valve is signaling a broad expansion of its hardware ecosystem. By building on the software maturity of SteamOS and the success of the Steam Deck, the company seems poised for a major new push into both living room and virtual reality gaming.</p>

                            <p>Valve, the company behind the dominant PC gaming platform Steam, has a mixed history with hardware. While the 2015 Steam Machines struggled, the company found major success with the Steam Deck, a powerful handheld gaming PC released in 2022.</p>
                            <p>This history of ambitious projects makes the new filings particularly interesting. The company has shown it can learn from past attempts to deliver products that resonate strongly with the gaming community, making the Steam Frame and new Steam Machine highly anticipated releases.</p>
