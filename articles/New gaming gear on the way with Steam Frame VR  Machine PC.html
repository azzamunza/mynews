        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div class="magazine-content">
            <p class="lead-paragraph">Hot on the heels of the successful Steam Deck, Valve has announced a trio of new hardware devices set for an early 2026 release. The lineup includes the 'Steam Frame' VR headset, a revived 'Steam Machine' compact gaming PC, and an updated Steam Controller, signalling a major push to make PC gaming more accessible beyond the desktop.</p>
            
            <p>The new Steam Machine is designed as a powerful yet small PC for big-screen gaming, effectively a more potent version of the technology found in the Steam Deck. It features a semi-custom AMD chip, 16GB of RAM, and supports 4K output, all within a quiet, 6-inch cube chassis designed to fit into any entertainment centre. It will run SteamOS, offering the same user-friendly experience as its portable counterpart but with significantly more power.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most anticipated device is the Steam Frame, a standalone VR headset. Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and 16GB of RAM, it runs a VR version of SteamOS and can play a user's entire Steam library, including non-VR titles on a large virtual screen. Positioned as a "streaming-first" device, it includes a dedicated 6GHz wireless adapter to ensure a stable, low-latency connection to a PC for high-end VR experiences, while also supporting standalone play.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">"We&#8217;ve been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries."</blockquote>

            <p>The headset boasts impressive specifications, including dual 2160x2160 LCD panels, pancake lenses for edge-to-edge clarity, and inside-out tracking, eliminating the need for external base stations. It is designed for comfort, weighing around 440 grams with a balanced, modular design. The accompanying new Steam Controllers have been redesigned with ergonomics in mind, featuring magnetic thumbsticks, trackpads, and full gamepad parity to handle both VR and traditional games.</p>
            
            <p>This strategic expansion suggests Valve is building an interconnected ecosystem, allowing gamers to access their Steam library seamlessly across handhelds, living room consoles, and immersive VR. While pricing remains unannounced, the new hardware is expected to ship to all regions that currently have access to the Steam Deck, including Australia.</p>

                <h3>Context: Valve's Hardware Evolution</h3>
                <p>Valve's journey into hardware began with the less successful Steam Machines in 2015. However, the company found massive success with the launch of the Steam Deck in 2022, a powerful PC gaming handheld that popularised the category. This new trio of devices—the Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller—represents the next logical step, leveraging the success and software foundation of SteamOS to create a cohesive gaming ecosystem.</p>
