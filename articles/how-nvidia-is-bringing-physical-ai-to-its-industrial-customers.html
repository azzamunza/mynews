Companies are now building sophisticated robotic factories and collaborative systems to tackle labour shortages and drive American reindustrialisation. This marks a significant step towards the smart factories of the future, powered by what the company calls "physical AI".</p><p>The core of this transformation lies in the use of digital twins—virtual models of physical factories. Partners such as Siemens, Foxconn Fii, Wistron, and Caterpillar are utilising NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate and refine their production lines with high fidelity before deploying them in the real world, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.</p><p>These advanced systems are designed to foster collaboration between humans and robots, creating a more flexible and intelligent manufacturing environment. By integrating physical AI, NVIDIA's platform enables robots to perform complex tasks with greater precision and adaptability, directly addressing the complexities of modern supply chains.</p><div class="magazine-image-block"><div class="magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-blue"><img src="https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Omniverse-for-Manufacturing-featured.jpg" alt="A digital twin of a manufacturing facility displayed on a screen, showing robotic arms and production lines." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"><div class="magazine-image-text">The New Industrial Revolution</div></div><div class="magazine-caption">NVIDIA's Omniverse platform allows companies to build and test digital twins of their factories, optimising automation and robotics.</div></div><p><strong>Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, emphasised the transformative impact of this technology.</strong> He stated that AI is turning the world's factories into intelligent thinking machines that will serve as the engines of a new industrial revolution.</p><div class="magazine-pullquote">"AI is transforming the world's factories into intelligent thinking machines — the engines of a new industrial revolution."</div><p>The push towards 'physical AI' represents a pivotal shift, where intelligent systems can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
