                        <p class="magazine-lead-text">Australia’s first tropical cyclone of the season could form as early as next week, with sea surface temperatures warming up off the northern coast. Weatherzone has reported sea surface temperatures are as high as 31 degrees in the region, well above the 26.5-degree minimum temperature required for a tropical cyclone to form.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of Meteorology’s tropical cyclone outlook has forecast a small chance a storm could form by next Tuesday. Some forecast models, however, show an increased chance of a storm forming around the end of next week. Residents in northern Australia are advised to monitor official weather forecasts closely.</p>

                        <p><strong>Atmospheric Conditions Ripe for Development</strong> Another factor increasing the likelihood of tropical cyclone activity is a pulse of tropical atmospheric waves. This wave, known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), is expected to pass over northern Australia and cause an increase in cloud and thunderstorm activity. This uptick in storminess can help form low-pressure systems, which can sometimes deepen into tropical cyclones.</p>

                        <p>Meteorologist Ben Domensino from Weatherzone noted the significance of the current conditions. The water temperatures are currently one to two degrees warmer than average for this time of year, creating an environment conducive to storm formation.</p>

                        <p>While the overall chances of a tropical cyclone forming next week remain slim, the combination of record-warm waters and atmospheric waves warrants close observation. Authorities are urging residents in vulnerable areas to stay informed and prepared as the cyclone season begins.</p>

                        <!-- Second Inline Image -->

                        <p>The development of a cyclone depends on these conditions persisting and aligning. The MJO is a major driver of weather patterns in the tropics and its influence next week will be critical. Even if a cyclone does not form, the increased moisture and storm activity will likely bring significant rainfall to parts of northern Australia.</p>

                        <p>Looking ahead, the early season potential for a cyclone serves as a timely reminder for communities to review their emergency plans. The official cyclone season runs from November to April, and preparation is key to ensuring safety during severe weather events.</p>

                            <p>The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a major fluctuation in tropical weather on weekly to monthly timescales. It can be characterised as an eastward-moving pulse of cloud and rainfall near the equator.</p>
                            <p>When the MJO passes over a region, it typically increases thunderstorm activity and creates an environment more favourable for the formation of tropical cyclones. Its presence next week is a key factor raising the cyclone risk for northern Australia.</p>
