                        <p class="magazine-lead-text">OpenAI is set to launch its GPT Store for custom AI chatbots later this month, following a brief delay. The store will allow creators to share and potentially monetise their specialised GPTs, which have seen significant uptake since their announcement at the company’s recent DevDay conference. The feature enables users to create tailored versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes without needing any coding skills.</p>
                        <p>Initially planned for a release last week, the launch was postponed as OpenAI continues to refine the platform based on user feedback. The company has been focused on making improvements since the initial announcement, which has generated considerable excitement. Since the GPT builder was made available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, tens of thousands of custom GPTs have already been created, tackling everything from coding assistance to creative writing.</p>

                        </div>


                        <p><strong>The platform aims to foster a new ecosystem for AI applications.</strong> Creators will be able to publish their GPTs for public use, with plans for a revenue-sharing program to be introduced in the coming months. This model is designed to reward the builders of the most useful and widely-used GPTs, creating an incentive for innovation within the community. The store will feature a leaderboard and searchable categories to help users discover popular and trending AIs.</p>


                        <p>In addition to the store, OpenAI announced it is rolling out ChatGPT with voice to all users, a feature previously exclusive to paid subscribers. This expansion signifies the company's commitment to making its technology more accessible and versatile for a broader audience. The core functionality of creating custom GPTs, however, will remain a feature for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users.</p>

                        <div class="magazine-pullquote">&quot;The ability for anyone to create their own GPT and share it publicly is a significant step towards democratising AI development.&quot;</div>


                        <p>The upcoming launch is a critical step in OpenAI’s strategy to evolve ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into a comprehensive platform. By empowering developers and enthusiasts to build on its technology, OpenAI is cultivating a community that can drive the practical application of AI into new and unforeseen areas.</p>

                        <p>This initiative follows a series of major announcements from OpenAI's DevDay, including the release of the more powerful GPT-4 Turbo model and the Assistants API, which allows for more complex AI integrations in third-party applications. The custom GPTs and the accompanying store are the most consumer-facing of these developments, promising to bring personalised AI into the mainstream.</p>


                        <p>As the launch date approaches, the technology community is keenly watching to see how the GPT Store will be received and what kinds of innovative applications will emerge from the creativity of its user base. The success of this marketplace could redefine how users interact with AI on a daily basis.</p>
