For decades, astronomers have wondered why red supergiants, which theoretical models predict should be the cause of most supernovae, are so rarely observed before they detonate. The new findings suggest they are often hidden behind thick clouds of dust.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>Piercing the Dusty Veil</h3><p>The supernova, named SN 2025pht, was first detected in June 2025 in the galaxy NGC 1637, located 38-40 million light-years from Earth. A team led by astronomers from Northwestern University used JWST's powerful infrared capabilities to analyse images of the area taken before the explosion. By comparing these with archival Hubble data, they identified the progenitor star.</p><p>The star was incredibly bright&mdash;about 100,000 times more luminous than our sun&mdash;but was shrouded in so much dust that its visible light was dimmed by more than 100 times. This dust blocked shorter, blue wavelengths of light, making the star appear extremely red. JWST's ability to see in infrared allowed it to pierce through this dusty cocoon and observe the star directly, marking the first time a supernova progenitor has been identified at mid-infrared wavelengths.</p></div></div><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\"><p>\"For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like.

A new study suggests that the Step Pyramid of Djoser, the oldest of Egypt's great pyramids, was built using a hydraulic-powered lift to manoeuvre the massive stone blocks.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>Evidence of a Water-Powered System</h3><p>Researchers concluded that the internal architecture of the Step Pyramid is consistent with a hydraulic elevation mechanism, a technology never before reported for that time period. The theory posits that water pressure was used to push the oversized stone blocks into place from the pyramid's interior in what the authors describe as a 'volcano fashion'. This system would have been fed by a sophisticated network of waterways.</p><div class=\"inline-image-right\"><img src=\"https://www.indy100.com/media-library/the-step-pyramid-of-djoser.jpg?id=55296803&width=980\" alt=\"An interior view of the corridors within the Step Pyramid of Djoser.\" class=\"content-image\"></div><p>Analysis of the landscape and nearby structures, such as the Gisr el-Mudir enclosure, suggests the existence of dams and a temporary lake that could have connected to a 'Dry Moat' around the pyramid complex. This moat would have been part of a unified hydraulic system that managed water quality and flow, providing the necessary power for construction.</p></div></div><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\"><p>\"This work opens a new line of research: the use of hydraulic force to erect the massive structures built by Pharaohs. We have uncovered a possible explanation for how the pyramids were built involving hydraulic force.\" <span class=\"source-attribution\">&mdash; Researchers, as stated in their paper</span></p></blockquote><h3>Implications of the Discovery</h3><p>If proven correct, this research demonstrates that ancient Egyptians possessed a powerful understanding of advanced hydraulic systems far earlier than previously believed. While some experts remain unconvinced, citing the lack of direct archaeological evidence for such machinery, the theory provides a compelling new perspective on ancient engineering capabilities.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> A new study suggests the Step Pyramid of Djoser was built using a hydraulic lift system.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The internal architecture is consistent with a mechanism powered by water pressure to move stone blocks.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Evidence points to a network of dams, a temporary lake, and a moat that formed a unified hydraulic system.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The discovery implies a much earlier and more advanced understanding of hydraulic engineering by ancient Egyptians.</li></ul></div>"
