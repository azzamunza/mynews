Researchers identified a massive red supergiant just before it exploded in a fiery supernova, an observation that helps explain why such stars are rarely seen exploding. The finding suggests these stellar giants are often obscured by thick clouds of dust.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>Piercing Through the Dust</h3><p>For decades, astronomers have puzzled over why massive red supergiants, which theoretical models predict should account for most supernovae, are seldom observed. This new JWST observation supports the theory that these stars are shrouded in dust, making them appear over 100 times dimmer and blocking shorter, bluer wavelengths of light. JWST's powerful infrared detection capabilities allowed it to pierce through this dusty veil and capture the longer red wavelengths, offering an unprecedentedly detailed look.</p><div class=\"inline-image-right\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vv9G8w2/pexels-alena-darmel-7724316.jpg\" alt=\"An artist's impression of a red supergiant star, a massive, luminous star in its final stages of life.\" class=\"content-image\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Red supergiants are among the largest stars in the universe.</p></div><p>The supernova, named SN 2025pht, was first detected in June from the galaxy NGC 1637, located 38 million light-years from Earth.

The data indicates the star shone about 100,000 times brighter than our sun, but the thick surrounding dust made it appear incredibly red and dim.

Rather than moving matter, a team from the University of Oxford successfully sent a quantum algorithm wirelessly from one quantum processor to another, enabling the two machines to function as a single, more powerful supercomputer. This was accomplished through quantum entanglement, where connected particles share information instantaneously over a distance.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>The Power of Entanglement</h3><p>The experiment involved linking two quantum computers separated by a distance of two metres. Through quantum entanglement, the processors could see each other's data and pool their resources without any matter being physically moved. This breakthrough addresses a key scalability problem in quantum computing, which has been limited by the difficulty of packing millions of qubits (the basic unit of quantum information) into a single device.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"This breakthrough will enable distributed quantum computing where many remote quantum processors can be combined into a unified quantum computer.\" <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash; BGR</span></p></div><p>This new approach allows for a network of smaller quantum devices to be linked together, distributing computations and theoretically allowing for an unlimited number of processors in the network. The team successfully demonstrated the method by running Grover's search algorithm across the two linked machines.</p></div></div><h3>A Step Towards the Quantum Internet</h3><p>This achievement is a significant step towards creating a 'quantum internet,' a network of interconnected quantum computers that could tackle computational challenges far beyond the reach of today's most powerful conventional supercomputers. By sharing data instantaneously, these networked machines can solve problems they would be unable to handle individually, opening up new possibilities for science and technology.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Scientists used quantum entanglement to link two quantum computers, allowing them to share data and work as one.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> This form of 'teleportation' transfers information, not physical matter.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The breakthrough helps solve the scalability problem of quantum computing by allowing smaller machines to be networked together.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> This development is a foundational step toward building a powerful, distributed quantum internet.</li></ul></div>"

The bank's analysts estimate that Tesla could capture a significant share of a projected ~$9 trillion humanoid robot market by 2050, viewing the opportunity as a key driver for the company's future growth.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>A $9 Trillion Market</h3><p>Following a tour of Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory, RBC noted that the company plans to integrate Optimus across three main verticals: manufacturing, hospitality, and consumer use. RBC believes the total addressable market (TAM) for humanoid robots could reach approximately $9 trillion globally by 2050, with the largest segments being households, agriculture, manufacturing, and retail.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"We estimate TSLA could capture 5% of our projected ~$9T humanoid robot market by 2050.\" <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash; RBC Capital Markets</span></p></div><p>For Tesla specifically, RBC assumes a focus on the consumer, manufacturing, and hospitality segments, resulting in a Tesla-specific TAM of $4.3 trillion. Based on these assumptions, the analysts project that Tesla could generate $404 billion in humanoid-related revenue by 2050.</p></div></div><h3>Revising Valuations</h3><div class=\"stats-grid\"><div class=\"stat-box\"><span class=\"stat-number\">$500</span><span class=\"stat-label\">New Price Target from RBC</span></div><div class=\"stat-box\"><span class=\"stat-number\">$9 Trillion</span><span class=\"stat-label\">Projected Humanoid Robot Market by 2050</span></div><div class=\"stat-box\"><span class=\"stat-number\">$404 Billion</span><span class=\"stat-label\">Potential Annual Robot Revenue for Tesla</span></div></div><p>This new analysis fundamentally changes Tesla's valuation breakdown. According to RBC, the humanoid robot segment now accounts for 36% of its total valuation. This is followed by Robotaxi at 37%, Full Self-Driving (FSD) at 11%, and the traditional car and Megapack businesses each at 8%. This shift underscores the growing investor focus on Tesla's AI and robotics ambitions beyond its core automotive business.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> RBC Capital Markets increased its Tesla price target from $325 to $500.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The new valuation is heavily based on the market potential of the Optimus humanoid robot.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> RBC projects a global humanoid robot market of ~$9 trillion by 2050.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The Optimus robot division now represents 36% of RBC's total valuation for Tesla.</li></ul></div>"
