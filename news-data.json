A geoarchaeological study, published in the journal *Antiquity*, used sediment cores and pottery analysis to reconstruct the ancient landscape, showing that the temple's location was deliberately chosen to align with Egyptian creation mythology. This discovery reframes the origins of one of the world's largest ancient religious sites.</p><h3>The Primeval Mound of Creation</h3><p>The study found that shifts in the Nile River's channels created a raised island of land around 2520 BCE. This island, the only known high ground surrounded by water in the Thebes region, was seen by ancient Egyptians as a “primeval mound,” symbolising the first land to emerge from the primordial waters in their creation myth. The temple's construction on this specific site was therefore a powerful religious statement, connecting the sacred space to the birth of the cosmos.</p><ul><li><strong>Geological Analysis:</strong> 61 sediment cores were analysed to map the ancient river channels.</li><li><strong>Earliest Occupation:</strong> Pottery fragments confirm the first phase of temple construction between 2300–1980 BCE.</li><li><strong>Mythological Link:</strong> The location reflects the myth of the sun god Amun-Ra rising from the waters of creation.</li></ul><blockquote><p>\"This new research provides unprecedented detail on the evolution of Karnak Temple, from a small island to one of the defining institutions of Ancient Egypt.\" - Dr. Ben Pennington, University of Southampton</p></blockquote><h3>Engineering a Sacred Landscape</h3><p>Over millennia, the landscape was shaped by both natural river movements and deliberate human engineering. As the temple complex expanded, ancient engineers filled in waterways with sand to create more land for construction. The study demonstrates how modern science can illuminate the hidden geological and mythological layers of ancient monuments, reshaping our understanding of how the Nile's geography influenced Egyptian religion and power.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Karnak Temple was intentionally built on a natural island formed by the Nile River.</li><li>The location was chosen to symbolise the “primeval mound” from Egyptian creation myths.</li><li>Geoarchaeological research has provided a new timeline for the temple's earliest construction.</li><li>The findings highlight the deep connection between Egyptian religion, geography, and engineering.</li></ul></div>"

The findings were published in the journal *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.</p><h3>Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation</h3><p>First theorised in 2007, dark stars are believed to have formed in the early universe from clouds of hydrogen and helium mixed with a high concentration of dark matter. Instead of collapsing to a point where nuclear fusion ignites, the heat generated by the annihilation of dark matter particles would support these stars against gravitational collapse. This process would allow them to grow into extraordinarily massive and bright objects, potentially reaching a million times the mass of our sun.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy Source:</strong> Heat from the annihilation of dark matter particles, not nuclear fusion.</li><li><strong>Composition:</strong> Primarily hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of dark matter.</li><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Extremely large, bright, and 'puffy' compared to normal stars.</li><li><strong>Candidates:</strong> Four distant objects identified by JWST, including JADES-GS-z14-0.</li></ul><blockquote><p>\"Discovering a new type of star is pretty interesting all by itself, but discovering it's dark matter that's powering this—that would be huge.\" - Katherine Freese, The University of Texas at Austin</p></blockquote><h3>Implications for Cosmology</h3><p>The existence of dark stars could help solve several cosmological puzzles. It could explain the presence of unexpectedly bright galaxies observed by JWST in the early universe, as a single supermassive dark star could be as luminous as an entire galaxy of normal stars.

These models, built on the Gemini 2.0 foundation, allow robots to process information from their environment, plan multi-step actions, and execute complex tasks with greater autonomy. This development marks a crucial step toward creating general-purpose robots that can be genuinely helpful in the physical world.</p><h3>The Role of Each Model</h3><p>Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 acts as the 'high-level brain', responsible for reasoning about the physical world and creating detailed plans to complete a mission. It can even use tools like Google Search to find necessary information. Gemini Robotics 1.5, a vision-language-action model, then translates these plans and visual data into direct motor commands, enabling the robot to perform the required actions.</p><h3>Industry Collaboration and Future Impact</h3><p>Google DeepMind is collaborating with several robotics companies, including Boston Dynamics and Apptronik, to integrate these new models into various robotic platforms, such as the humanoid robot Apollo. The ability for robots to learn skills and transfer that knowledge to other robots is a key feature of this new technology. This advancement is expected to accelerate the development of more versatile robots capable of assisting with a wide range of tasks in both domestic and industrial settings.</p><blockquote><p>\"These advances will help developers build more capable and versatile robots that can actively understand their environment to complete complex, multi-step tasks in a general way.\" - Google DeepMind</p></blockquote><div class=\"key-takeaways\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Google DeepMind has launched two new AI models to enhance robot intelligence.</li><li>Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 provides high-level reasoning, while Gemini Robotics 1.5 executes physical actions.</li><li>These models enable robots to perform complex, multi-step tasks and learn new skills.</li></ul></div>"

These shifts are impacting the stratospheric polar vortex, a large area of rotating winds that typically keeps cold air trapped over the continent.</p><h3>Impacts on the Polar Vortex</h3><p>The unusual warming in Antarctica is weakening the polar vortex, causing it to become unstable and, in some cases, on the verge of splitting. This disruption can lead to significant weather changes in the southern hemisphere, including hotter and drier conditions in Australia.

This news comes after the successful conclusion of the anime's second season, leaving fans eager for more content. While a third season has not yet been officially announced, the prospect of a film adaptation has generated significant excitement within the community.</p><h3>Clarification on Canonicity</h3><p>In a recent interview, Chugong clarified that *Solo Leveling: Ragnarok*, which many considered a direct sequel, is actually a spin-off created as 'fan service'. He compared the expanded universe to Marvel's parallel universes, suggesting that *Ragnarok* is just one of many possible storylines. This clarification has opened the door for Chugong to write his own official sequel to the main plot.</p><h3>Future of the Franchise</h3><p>The potential for a new movie adds another layer to the expanding *Solo Leveling* franchise, which already includes a live-action Netflix series in development. The success of other anime films, such as *Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle*, has demonstrated the high demand for theatrical releases of popular series. A movie could explore a significant arc from the web novel or present an entirely new story, further enriching the world of hunters and monsters.</p><blockquote><p>\"I was curious to see how another author would write Solo Leveling.

This groundbreaking hypothesis challenges long-held beliefs that the colossal stone blocks were moved using only ramps and rollers. If confirmed, this theory could rewrite our understanding of ancient Egyptian engineering capabilities.</p><h3>How the Hydraulic System May Have Worked</h3><p>Researchers propose that a sophisticated water management system was used to create a hydraulic lift that raised the massive stone blocks through the pyramid's interior. This system may have involved a 'check dam' to create a temporary lake, which then fed water into shafts within the pyramid. The controlled flow of water would have powered a float or platform, lifting the blocks to higher levels of the structure.</p><h3>Evidence and Implications</h3><p>The theory is based on computer models, satellite imagery, and the pyramid's internal architecture, which researchers argue is consistent with a hydraulic elevation mechanism. This suggests that the ancient Egyptians possessed a deep understanding of hydraulics long before it was previously thought.
