Courtesy of Armando Mei.</div></div><h2>Rediscovered Shafts Hint at Vast Subterranean Network at Giza</h2><p class=\"lead-paragraph\">Three precisely engineered shafts hidden beneath the sands of Egypt's Giza Plateau have been rediscovered, potentially unlocking access to a vast underground network described by ancient historians. Located in the area between the Great Sphinx and the pyramids of Khufu and Khafre, these vertical passages descend over 40 metres into the bedrock with a precision that challenges conventional explanations of their purpose.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>Echoes of a Lost Labyrinth</h3><p>The shafts may provide the first physical evidence for the accounts of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote of a massive, 3,000-chamber labyrinth in Egypt, much of it hidden underground. For centuries, scholars have debated whether Herodotus's account was fact or fiction. These rediscovered passages, combined with modern scanning technologies that have revealed anomalies beneath the plateau, suggest the ancient writer may have been describing a real architectural wonder that has eluded archaeologists until now.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"Every measurement, every radar image, points to a singular conclusion: the Giza Plateau still holds secrets that could reshape our understanding of ancient Egypt. The shafts are more than anomalies; they are doorways into a subterranean world waiting to be explored.\" <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash; Armando Mei, Khafre Research Project</span></p></div><p>The purpose of these shafts remains a mystery, though theories suggest they could have been part of a sophisticated water management system, ventilation for underground structures, or access to ceremonial spaces. What is becoming clear is that the Giza Plateau contains an extensive subterranean dimension that has been largely overlooked by conventional archaeology.</p></div></div><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Three deep, precisely engineered shafts have been rediscovered on the Giza Plateau.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The shafts descend over 40 metres and are located between the Sphinx and the great pyramids.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The discovery may lend credibility to ancient accounts of a vast underground labyrinth by the historian Herodotus.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Researchers believe the Giza Plateau holds a significant, unexplored subterranean dimension that could reshape our understanding of ancient Egypt.</li></ul></div>"

For decades, astronomers have wondered why they rarely observe red supergiants exploding, despite theoretical models predicting they should account for most core-collapse supernovae. This discovery confirms that these stars do explode but are often hidden from view by thick clouds of dust.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>Piercing the Cosmic Dust</h3><p>The supernova, named SN 2025pht, occurred in the galaxy NGC 1637, located 38 million light-years from Earth. By comparing new JWST images with archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, a team led by Northwestern University pinpointed the progenitor star. The star radiated about 100,000 times more light than the Sun, but its thick dust shroud made it appear over 100 times dimmer in visible light. JWST's powerful infrared capabilities allowed it to see through this dust, revealing the doomed star.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like.

These AI tools can produce high-quality text, images, and music from simple prompts, raising fundamental questions about the future of creative work and the value of human creativity.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>A Double-Edged Sword for Creatives</h3><p>For some creative professionals, generative AI presents a powerful new set of tools that can augment their skills, accelerate workflows, and open up new avenues of expression. It can handle tedious tasks, generate ideas, and produce assets, freeing up human creators to focus on higher-level strategy and conceptualisation. However, this same technology threatens to devalue and displace human labour in the creative industries.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"The potential for AI to automate creative work is both an opportunity and a threat. It forces us to reconsider what skills are uniquely human and how we can best collaborate with these increasingly capable systems.\" <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash; Industry Analyst</span></p></div><p>The debate extends to issues of copyright, originality, and compensation. As AI models are often trained on vast datasets of existing human-created content, questions arise about intellectual property rights and whether human artists should be compensated when their work is used to train these systems. The economic and ethical frameworks of the creative industries are struggling to keep pace with the technology's evolution.</p></div></div><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Generative AI is capable of automating content creation, posing a significant disruption to creative professions.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The technology acts as both a powerful tool for augmenting human creativity and a potential threat to creative jobs.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> Key challenges include navigating complex issues of copyright, intellectual property, and fair compensation for artists.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The creative economy must adapt to integrate AI ethically and sustainably, redefining the role of human creators.</li></ul></div>"

The telescope identified a massive red supergiant, the source of a supernova, for the first time in mid-infrared light. The finding reveals that these stellar behemoths are often shrouded in thick dust, explaining why they are so rarely seen exploding.</p><div class=\"article-columns\"><div class=\"content-column\"><h3>The Dust-Cloaked Giant</h3><p>The discovery bridges a significant gap between supernova theory and observation. While models predict that red supergiants should be responsible for most core-collapse supernovae, they have been conspicuously absent in observations. This new data suggests they do explode as predicted but are simply hidden from view. JWST's powerful infrared vision was able to pierce through the obscuring dust cloud to find the progenitor star of supernova SN2025pht.</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"This breakthrough may finally explain why astronomers rarely see red supergiants explode, even though models predict they should account for most core-collapse supernovae.\" <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash; ScienceDaily</span></p></div><p>The star, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 1637 about 40 million light-years from Earth, was found to be about 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun, though much of its light was hidden by the dust. This marks JWST's first confirmed detection of a supernova's progenitor star, opening a new era for studying the final moments of massive stars.</p></div></div><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"takeaway-list\"><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The JWST has provided the first mid-infrared identification of a red supergiant star before it went supernova.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The discovery solves the mystery of why red supergiant explosions are rarely seen: they are often hidden by thick dust clouds.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> The observed star was extremely luminous but appeared dim in visible light due to its dusty shroud.</li><li><span class=\"takeaway-bullet\">&#10004;</span> This is the first time JWST has been used to confirm a supernova's progenitor, marking a new capability for the telescope.</li></ul></div>"
