He Also Gets Paid to Hate AI</h1><p class='magazine-subtitle'>A profile of Ed Zitron, a public relations professional known for his sharp critique of the overblown and misleading claims common in AI press releases.</p><p class='magazine-byline'>BY <strong>Wired Staff</strong></p></div><div class='magazine-content-wrapper'><div class='magazine-main-content'><p class='magazine-lead-text'>Public relations professional Ed Zitron has carved out a unique and controversial space in the tech world: he runs a PR firm, EZPR, that represents tech companies, while simultaneously being one of the most vocal and sharp-tongued critics of the artificial intelligence industry's hype. This dual role has led to a growing profile for Zitron, who uses his newsletter 'Where's Your Ed At' and podcast 'Better Offline' to dismantle what he sees as the unsubstantiated and often misleading claims from major AI players.</p><p>Zitron argues that the current wave of AI-related PR is filled with jargon and lacks substance, advocating for a more grounded and honest approach to communicating about technology. His critiques often focus on the financial unsustainability and exaggerated capabilities of generative AI models. He has famously referred to prominent tech CEOs as 'chunderfucks' and their promises as 'gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit,' arguing that their companies burn through billions of dollars with no viable path to profitability.</p><div class='magazine-image-block'><div class='magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-blue'><img src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68fb9ff84f886f50f060be36/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Ed-Zitron-2x1-1.jpg' alt='Profile of Ed Zitron' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;'><div class='magazine-image-text'>The Critic</div></div><div class='magazine-caption'>Ed Zitron has become a prominent voice questioning the AI industry's growth-at-all-costs mindset.</div></div><p><strong>A Moral Language for Hating AI</strong>What sets Zitron apart from other AI skeptics is his focus on providing a 'moral language for hating generative AI'. He isn't a traditional doomer worried about superintelligence; instead, he frames his criticism in terms of business ethics and consumer harm. His 2023 newsletter on 'The Rot Economy' went viral for articulating how tech firms have prioritised growth over innovation and quality, a theme that continues in his AI commentary.</p><div class='magazine-pullquote'>&quot;I work with founders all the time... when you see these chunderfucks burning 5, 10 billion dollars in a year—and everyone's celebrating them? It's offensive.&quot;</div><p>Despite his harsh critiques, Zitron claims it hasn't cost him business, as he offers a blueprint for companies to build real products with sustainable value. He provides a counter-narrative to the dominant AI hype, attracting a significant following of those disillusioned with the tech industry's current trajectory.</p><div class='magazine-image-block'><div class='magazine-image-container' style='height: auto; background: #000;'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAK4Y3m4wJ0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen title='The ROT Economy: Ed Zitron&#39;s Unflinching Take on Tech&#39;s Broken Priorities'></iframe></div></div><div class='magazine-caption'>In interviews and his podcast, Zitron frequently discusses what he terms the 'ROT economy' in the tech sector.</div></div></div><div class='magazine-sidebar'><div class='magazine-sidebar-image magazine-image-gradient-purple'><img src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68fb9ff84f886f50f060be36/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Ed-Zitron-2x1-1.jpg' alt='Ed Zitron sidebar portrait' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;'><div class='magazine-sidebar-image-text'>The Insider</div></div><div class='magazine-caption'>Zitron leverages his PR industry experience to deconstruct tech narratives.</div><div class='magazine-sidebar-box'><h3>By The Numbers</h3><div class='magazine-stat-item'><div class='magazine-stat-number'>70K+</div><div class='magazine-stat-label'>Subscribers & listeners for his newsletter and podcast</div></div><div class='magazine-stat-item'><div class='magazine-stat-number'>$9B</div><div class='magazine-stat-label'>Amount OpenAI burned in 2024, a frequent Zitron critique</div></div><div class='magazine-stat-item'><div class='magazine-stat-number'>2013</div><div class='magazine-stat-label'>Year he founded his public relations agency, EZPR</div></div></div><div class='magazine-sidebar-box'><h3>Key Context</h3><p>Ed Zitron's critique is part of a growing skepticism towards the 'growth-at-all-costs' mindset in Silicon Valley. He argues that the AI boom is a bubble, similar to past tech hypes, and that the business models of major players like OpenAI are fundamentally unsustainable.</p><p>His perspective is valued because, as a PR professional himself, he has deep insight into the mechanics of hype and media manipulation used by tech companies. This allows him to dissect press releases and CEO statements with an expert eye.</p></div></div></div><div class='magazine-bottom-section'><div class='magazine-full-width-image magazine-image-gradient-green'><img src='https://img.youtube.com/vi/aAK4Y3m4wJ0/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Video thumbnail for The ROT Economy' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;'><div class='magazine-image-text' style='font-size: 32px;'>The Rot Economy</div></div><div class='magazine-caption'>Zitron's viral thesis argues that technology firms have focused on growth above all else, harming innovation and consumers.</div></div></div>"

This critical limit, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, is fundamental to understanding the final stages of stellar evolution and the birth of black holes.</p><p>Neutron stars are the incredibly dense remnants of massive stars that have exploded as supernovae. They are surpassed in density only by black holes themselves, packing a mass greater than our sun into a sphere just a few kilometres in diameter. Until now, pinning down the exact mass at which a neutron star's internal pressure can no longer withstand its own gravity has been a significant challenge for astrophysicists.</p><div class=\"magazine-image-block\"><div class=\"magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-blue\"><img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2015/10/artist_s_impression_of_a_magnetar/16117398-1-eng-GB/Artist_s_impression_of_a_magnetar_pillars.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's impression of a magnetar, a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field.\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\"><div class=\"magazine-image-text\">Densest Objects</div></div><div class=\"magazine-caption\">An artist's rendering of a magnetar, a special type of neutron star.

By combining theoretical models with observational data from events like the merging of two neutron stars, scientists can make calculations that are independent of the specific equation of state, which describes the exotic matter inside the star. This provides a more robust and reliable upper limit.</p><div class=\"magazine-pullquote\">&quot;If a neutron star stays below that Oppenheimer limit, it will remain in that state. If it grows more massive, then it collapses into a black hole.&quot;</div><p>The updated findings suggest a non-rotating neutron star cannot exceed a mass of around 2.25 solar masses. Should a neutron star accrete more matter and surpass this threshold, its collapse into a black hole is inevitable.

This non-invasive technique allowed scientists to see beneath layers of rust without damaging the artifact, revealing the signature of a master craftsman and illuminating the history of the high-status weapon.</p><p>The sword was recovered from the historic Collegium Jenense in Jena, Germany, the original site of the University of Jena which was founded in 1548. The CT scans unveiled the signature 'Clemes Stam,' identifying the blade as the work of a documented swordsmith from Solingen. During the Renaissance, Solingen was a renowned European centre for blade-making, supplying weapons to nobility across the continent.</p><div class=\"magazine-image-block\"><div class=\"magazine-image-container magazine-image-gradient-blue\"><img src=\"https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/field/image/Sword_2.jpg?itok=EgE9cHAe\" alt=\"A corroded Renaissance-era sword before restoration.\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\"><div class=\"magazine-image-text\">The Corroded Sword</div></div><div class=\"magazine-caption\">The 16th-century sword as it appeared before the non-invasive CT scanning analysis revealed its secrets.</div></div><p><strong>A Window into the Past.</strong> The use of industrial CT scanning in archaeology is a revolutionary step, allowing for the virtual excavation of artifacts. This technology creates high-resolution 3D models, making internal structures and hidden details visible without physical intervention. The discovery on the Jena sword demonstrates how 21st-century imaging can solve historical mysteries.</p><div class=\"magazine-pullquote\">&quot;CT doesn't just capture surface details; it reveals the object's inner story. In this case, it literally uncovered a name that connects Jena to the European tradition of sword-making.&quot;</div><p>The intricate craftsmanship, likely a form of damascening, indicated the sword was a premium piece commissioned by an individual of considerable wealth. Given its burial location, researchers believe it may have belonged to a university rector or a student of noble lineage.</p><div class=\"magazine-image-block\"><div class=\"magazine-image-container\" style=\"height: auto; background: #000;\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAF50J0SgLs\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Demonstration of CT Scanning Technology\"></iframe></div></div><div class=\"magazine-caption\">A demonstration of computed tomography (CT) technology, similar to the method used to analyse the Renaissance sword.</div></div><p>Concluding the analysis, the project successfully preserved the artifact while adding a significant chapter to the university's history.
