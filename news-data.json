This innovation, detailed in the journal *ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces*, promises to revolutionise lighting in homes, devices, and workplaces by providing a quality of light that is remarkably close to natural sunlight.</p><p>The new design relies on a carefully engineered balance of red, yellow-green, and blue quantum dots. By synthesising quantum dots coated with zinc-sulfur shells and determining the precise ratio needed, the researchers successfully recreated the balanced spectrum of sunlight. This achievement not only improves colour accuracy in artificial lighting but also helps reduce the eye strain and sleep disruption often caused by harsh artificial lights.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">This new design could illuminate the future of phone and computer screens as well as other lighting applications.</div><p>The development team combined expertise in quantum dots with an efficient conductive material design, allowing the ultra-thin white quantum dot LED (QLED) to operate effectively at low voltages. This efficiency makes the technology a viable candidate for future applications in a wide range of electronic devices and general lighting solutions.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>Scientists have created an ultra-thin, paper-like LED using quantum dot technology.</li><li>The LED replicates the full spectrum of natural sunlight, which can reduce eye strain.</li><li>The innovation was achieved by balancing red, yellow-green, and blue quantum dots.</li><li>This technology could transform screens for devices like phones and computers, as well as general home and workplace lighting.</li></ul></div>"

The statement came ahead of the game's release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X, addressing recent industry and consumer discussions around the use of AI in game development.</p><p>Rebecka Coutaz, a VP general manager at one of the studios involved, explained that while generative AI was utilised in the very early preparatory stages to help the team be more creative, it was not used to create content for the final product. This clarification comes as the games industry grapples with resistance from creatives and consumers regarding generative AI, even as investors see potential for cost-cutting.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">Coutaz described the technology as \"very seducing\" but noted that a clear way to incorporate it into development workflows is not yet established.</blockquote><p>The announcement also arrives shortly after EA revealed a major buyout deal to take the company private, with investors reportedly interested in the cost-saving potential of increased AI usage. Despite this, for its biggest launch in franchise history, EA has maintained a traditional development approach for in-game content.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>Electronic Arts stated that no generative AI-created content is present in the final version of Battlefield 6.</li><li>AI was used during early ideation phases to foster creativity but not for final asset production.</li><li>An EA executive called the technology \"very seducing\" but acknowledged challenges in its implementation.</li><li>The clarification addresses concerns from creatives and players about the role of generative AI in game development.</li></ul></div>"
