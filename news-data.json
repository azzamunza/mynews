The joint team explored how quantum-enhanced machine learning could improve Telstra's response to complex connectivity challenges.</p><h3>Testing a Quantum Reservoir</h3><p>The collaboration tested SQC's quantum-enhanced machine learning system, known as Watermelon, which functions as a quantum reservoir. This system was tasked with forecasting network metrics using real, historical network data on SQC's locally developed silicon-based quantum processor. The goal was to determine if features generated by the quantum reservoir could effectively predict network performance and compare it against existing deep learning models.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\"><p>\"For us, we see this as huge breakthrough demonstration on how quantum-enhanced AI could realistically be used within the telco industry and on the Telstra network.\"</p><cite>- Telstra</cite></blockquote><h3>Breakthrough Results and Future Implications</h3><p>The trial yielded impressive results. The quantum reservoir model achieved comparable accuracy to the existing deep learning model but was trained and fine-tuned in just a few days, compared to the weeks required for the conventional model. This demonstrates a significant potential for quantum-enhanced AI in the telecommunications industry.</p><div class=\"highlight-box info-box\"><h4>What is a Quantum Reservoir?</h4><p>A quantum reservoir uses the properties of quantum mechanics to process input data in a rich, dynamic way. In this trial, it analysed vast streams of telco data, such as call logs and latency, to identify patterns and make predictions more efficiently than classical systems.</p></div><h3>A Foundation for the Future</h3><p>This successful trial lays the groundwork for broader investigations into quantum technology for digital infrastructure and other real-world industry applications. The collaboration between Telstra, an investor in SQC, and the quantum computing firm highlights how Australian industry and homegrown innovation can drive the nation's digital future.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Telstra and SQC successfully trialled a quantum-enhanced machine learning system on real network data.</li><li>The quantum reservoir, named Watermelon, achieved comparable accuracy to existing deep learning models.</li><li>Training and fine-tuning the quantum model took only a few days, a significant speed increase over the weeks required for the conventional model.</li><li>The trial represents a major step in moving quantum computing from theoretical research to practical industry applications.</li></ul></div>"

Despite real-world fibre losses, the link produced strong secret key rates, proving its readiness for practical application. This marks one of the first publicly documented deployments of QKD over telecom-grade dark fibre in Australia.
