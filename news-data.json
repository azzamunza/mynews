Each module used ions to store and transmit quantum data, which were linked when they emitted photons that travelled to a central analyser.

The breakthrough involves the instantaneous sharing of quantum information between two computers, not the movement of physical objects. A team from the University of Oxford detailed in the journal *Nature* how they wirelessly sent a quantum algorithm between two separate quantum processors by leveraging the phenomenon of quantum entanglement.</p><p>This achievement allows two powerful computers to function as a single, more powerful supercomputer, pooling their resources to solve problems they could not tackle alone. The process is fueled by quantum entanglement, a principle where two particles, such as photons or electrons, become linked and remain connected regardless of the distance separating them. In this experiment, the particles, known as qubits, were separated by two meters.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">\"Quantum entanglement allows the two computers to see each other's data, sharing that information instantaneously across huge distances and pooling resources.\"</div><p>It is crucial to understand that during the experiment, nothing physically moved between the two computers.

In a paper published in *PLOS ONE*, scientists propose that ancient Egyptian engineers harnessed water power to hoist the massive stone blocks, some weighing over 2.5 metric tons, used to build the monument.</p><p>The research team concluded that the internal architecture of the pyramid at Saqqara is consistent with a hydraulic elevator mechanism, a technology never before reported for this time period. The system would have guided water from a nearby dam and treatment facility through 7 kilometers of underground conduits to a central well 28 meters deep beneath the pyramid. Through filling and draining cycles, this would have raised a float carrying the heavy stones.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">\"Djoser's pyramid would have been erected like a volcano, with building materials arriving at its central axis.\"</div><p>This method, described by the authors as construction in a “volcano fashion,” involves lifting stones from the interior of the pyramid and pushing them into place with water pressure. The study also re-identified what was previously thought to be Pharaoh Djoser's sarcophagus plug as a hydraulic opening and closing mechanism, acting as a crucial tap in the system. This suggests a powerful understanding of advanced hydraulic systems far earlier than previously believed.</p><p>While some scholars remain unconvinced that there was sufficient water from sporadic rains to power such a large-scale system, the authors maintain that the available water in the area was sufficient.

According to NASA data, the Antarctic polar vortex—a vast, swirling mass of cold air in the stratosphere—is showing clear signs of weakening and destabilization much earlier than its typical seasonal cycle. This event's intensity and premature timing are surprising experts and could have widespread meteorological consequences far beyond the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>The polar vortex acts as a crucial regulator of the Earth's climate, functioning as an invisible barrier that contains extremely cold air over the Antarctic continent. Unlike its more chaotic counterpart in the Arctic, the Antarctic vortex is typically stable due to the uniform atmospheric environment provided by the Southern Ocean. However, recent observations reveal anomalies pointing to a potential “Sudden Stratospheric Warming” (SSW) event, a phenomenon rarely seen in the Antarctic.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">\"Recent observations from monitoring instruments reveal a triple anomaly signalling this change: Weakening Winds, Temperature Rise, and Abnormal Pressure.\"</div><p>These indicators—weakening atmospheric currents, an abnormal increase in stratospheric heat, and rising atmospheric pressure—are occurring several weeks ahead of schedule. A similar record-breaking event in September 2019 demonstrated that disruptions over Antarctica can generate meteorological anomalies felt as far away as Europe and North America, proving that atmospheric events in the polar regions have a global reach. The current destabilization raises fears that it could lead to both icy blasts and extreme heatwaves across the southern hemisphere.</p><p>While scientists are still uncertain about the exact causes of such destabilization, growing evidence suggests a link to rising global temperatures and declining Antarctic sea ice. Studies have shown that warmer ocean temperatures can slow stratospheric wind speeds, interfering with the stability of the polar vortices. This event highlights the interconnectedness of the global climate system and serves as a potential warning of more dramatic weather patterns in the future.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>The Antarctic polar vortex is weakening and destabilizing weeks earlier than normal, according to NASA data.</li><li>This disruption could trigger a rare “Sudden Stratospheric Warming” (SSW) event over the South Pole.</li><li>Anomalies detected include weakening winds, rising stratospheric temperatures, and abnormal atmospheric pressure.</li><li>Such an event could have global climate impacts, affecting weather patterns far beyond Antarctica.</li><li>Evidence suggests a link between polar vortex instability, rising global temperatures, and declining sea ice.</li></ul></div>"
