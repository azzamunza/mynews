These entities are not directly detectable but are crucial for describing fundamental forces.</p><div class=\"side-image-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWhmjZCkCuKVFsnmWYJ6p-1920-80.png\" alt=\"Abstract quantum field\"><p>Virtual particles are used to model three of the four fundamental forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. They provide a framework for understanding how forces can act over a distance in empty space.</p></div><div class=\"highlight-box info-box\"><h3>Data &amp; Insights</h3><p>Calculations involving virtual particles, often visualised using Feynman diagrams, have been experimentally verified with extremely high precision. This success has led some physicists to debate whether these 'bookkeeping' tricks might represent a deeper aspect of reality.</p></div><h3>Broader Impact</h3><p>The existence of virtual particles is a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum field theory.

The European Commission has introduced the European Drone Defence Initiative as part of its 'Defence Readiness Roadmap 2030'.</p><div class=\"side-image-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RHwAXRLUfFkoVqd869UA4-1920-80.jpg\" alt=\"Military radar system\"><p>The initiative aims to establish a comprehensive system to detect, track, and neutralise drone threats, including swarms. It will also incorporate capabilities for precision strikes against ground targets.</p></div><div class=\"highlight-box info-box\"><h3>Data &amp; Insights</h3><p>Recent drone incidents over airports in Munich and Copenhagen, as well as incursions into Polish airspace, have underscored the urgent need for a coordinated response. The initial operational capabilities of the drone defence system are expected by the end of 2026, with full functionality planned for 2027.</p></div><h3>Broader Impact</h3><p>This move signifies a major step towards a more integrated European defence policy. The initiative is one of four 'European Readiness Flagships' designed to address pressing security threats and fortify the continent's borders. The plan is to leverage joint funding and draw lessons from the use of drones in Ukraine.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h4>Key Takeaways</h4><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>The EU is launching the European Drone Defence Initiative.</li><li>The system will detect, track, and neutralise drone threats.</li><li>It is a response to recent drone incursions across Europe and is expected to be fully operational by 2027.</li></ul></div>"
