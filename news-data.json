      "fullContent": "<h2>Exotic Matter Phase Finds Practical Use</h2><p>Time crystals, an exotic phase of matter that exhibits periodic structure in time rather than space, demonstrate practical applications in quantum computing by maintaining coherence significantly longer than conventional qubit implementations. This breakthrough addresses one of quantum computing's fundamental challenges.</p><h3>Time Crystal Properties</h3><p>Unlike ordinary crystals with repeating spatial patterns, time crystals exhibit periodic behaviour in their lowest energy state without consuming energy. This property makes them resistant to thermal noise and environmental disturbances that typically cause quantum decoherence.</p><ul><li><strong>Coherence Time:</strong> 100x improvement over standard qubits</li>"
