As a Senior Data Integrator and Content Strategist, I am ready to process and enrich the articles.

However, the **New Articles JSON** data was not provided in your prompt. To complete the task of verifying, formatting, and integrating the new content into the existing `news-data.json` structure, I require the new article data.

Please provide the `New Articles JSON` array, and I will execute the following plan:
1.  **Verify** all new source URLs, images, and videos for accessibility and correctness from an Australian perspective.
2.  **Generate** custom SVG fallbacks for any missing or invalid images to maintain visual integrity.
3.  **Enrich** the content by structuring it into the specified magazine-style HTML format, ensuring factual accuracy and adherence to the Australian English writing style.
4.  **Calculate** all required metadata, including `readTime`, `isTrending`, and `isVideo` flags.
5.  **Merge** the newly processed articles with the existing dataset.
6.  **Filter** the combined list to retain only articles published within the last 7 days (on or after October 7, 2025).
7.  **Sort** the final list to ensure the newest articles appear first.
8.  **Update** the top-level `categories` and `trending` arrays.
9.  **Deliver** the final, clean, and validated JSON object as requested.

I am awaiting the necessary data to proceed.
