Detecting the faint signals from this mysterious substance, which is believed to hold galaxies together, has been a major challenge in physics. This new approach could finally make it possible to capture the elusive clues left by dark matter.</p><p>The study centres on superconducting qubits, which are tiny, super-cooled electric circuits typically used in quantum computers. By linking these qubits, which act as powerful quantum sensors, the network can function as a single, super-sensitive detector. This collective arrangement allows for the detection of weak signals far more effectively than any individual sensor could achieve on its own, leveraging the principles of quantum entanglement.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">\"Our goal was to figure out how to organize and fine-tune quantum sensors so they can detect dark matter more reliably,\" stated Dr. Le Bin Ho, the study's lead author.</blockquote><h3>Broader Technological Implications</h3><p>Beyond the search for dark matter, these advanced quantum sensor networks have the potential to revolutionise other fields. Potential applications include the development of quantum radar, more precise gravitational wave detection, and ultra-accurate timekeeping. Dr. Ho added that this research opens the door to using quantum sensors in real-world tools that require extreme sensitivity, such as improving GPS accuracy and enhancing MRI brain imaging.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>Researchers propose using quantum networks of superconducting qubits to significantly increase sensitivity in dark matter detection.</li><li>Quantum entanglement allows the network to act as a single, highly effective detector, filtering out noise and amplifying faint signals.</li><li>The technology has wide-ranging applications beyond physics, including advancements in GPS, MRI, and gravitational wave detection.</li><li>The findings were published in the journal Physical Review D.</li></ul></div>"

This rare nuclear process could help explain why the universe is composed primarily of matter. The new technique allows scientists to better filter out distracting background signals from vibrations and other sources.</p><p>With a dataset now double the size of what was previously published, the CUORE collaboration has established new, stringent limits on the occurrence of this decay in tellurium atoms. The findings, published in the journal *Science*, suggest the event happens no more than once every 50 septillion years on average. The experiment uses 988 tellurium dioxide crystals cooled to just 10 millikelvin, making it the coldest cubic meter in the universe.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">\"The focus of this data release is understanding sources of external vibrations and learning how to subtract that from our data to better search for this extremely rare decay,\" said Reina Maruyama, U.S. spokesperson for CUORE.</blockquote><p>The new noise-subtraction techniques are not only pivotal for CUORE but could also benefit other highly sensitive detectors, including those used in dark matter and gravitational wave research.
