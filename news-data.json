I cross-checked your dataset against the provided “correct URLs” list. All matching items already have the correct links, so no changes were required.

Verified as correct:
- Articles
  - solo-leveling-ragnarok-us-release → https://www.cbr.com/solo-leveling-ragnarok-us-release/
  - it-help-desk-msp-perth → https://www.seek.com.au/job/75536416

  - humanoid-robots-breakthroughs-2025 → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB4-3a_A9o8

No reference links were provided for the remaining items, so they were left unchanged.

Optional: If you want, I can add additional sources (e.g., ScreenRant for the Ragnarok print news and ComicBook.com for the Blue Protocol launch) as secondary citations, but that would require a field to store multiple source URLs.
