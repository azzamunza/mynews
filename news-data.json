Separately, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation announced its 2025 class of Packard Fellows, which includes Dohyung Kim from Penn\'s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The fellowship provides $875,000 over five years for early-career scientists to pursue their research.</p><h3>Research Highlights from Penn State</h3><p>Meanwhile, researchers at Penn State have been active. One study revealed that Earth\'s continents stabilised due to furnace-like heat in the planet\'s early history. Another Penn State study suggests that if microbial life exists on Mars, its remains could be preserved in the planet\'s ice deposits. The research found that organic materials in pure ice are destroyed at a much slower rate than when mixed with soil, making icy regions ideal for searching for signs of life.</p><div class=\"highlight-box info-box\"><h3>Student Innovation</h3><p>At Penn\'s Climate Week, a "Shark Tank"—style competition called Transform Penn will allow students to pitch ideas for improving campus sustainability.

Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling and energy quantization in electrical circuits. This award recognizes a significant achievement in quantum science and technology, aligning with the United Nations\' designation of 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.</p><p>Quantum tunneling describes the ability of a particle to pass through a potential energy barrier that it classically should not be able to overcome. The laureates\' work demonstrated that this phenomenon is not limited to microscopic particles but can be observed in large systems, or \'macroscopic\' objects, comprising many thousands of electrons acting as a single entity. Their experiments with ultrathin superconducting wires showed that a whole collection of superconducting electrons could \'tunnel\' from a state of higher electrical current to a lower one.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">This research provides further evidence that the laws of quantum mechanics continue to govern large systems.</div><p>The historical context for this discovery dates back to the early 20th century with Max Planck\'s introduction of energy quantization and Albert Einstein\'s explanation of the photoelectric effect, which proposed that light is made of discrete packets of energy called photons. These foundational ideas revolutionised physics and paved the way for understanding the quantum nature of our world, from the bonds holding atoms together to the behaviour of complex materials.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling.</li><li>The winners are John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis.</li><li>Their work showed that large collections of electrons in superconducting circuits can exhibit quantum tunneling, a behaviour previously thought to be limited to single particles.</li><li>The discovery builds on a century of quantum mechanics research, from Planck\'s energy quanta to modern quantum technology.</li></ul></div>"

The statement came ahead of the game\'s release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X, addressing recent industry and consumer discussions around the use of AI in game development.</p><p>Rebecka Coutaz, a VP general manager at one of the studios involved, explained that while generative AI was utilised in the very early preparatory stages to help the team be more creative, it was not used to create content for the final product. This clarification comes as the games industry grapples with resistance from creatives and consumers regarding generative AI, even as investors see potential for cost-cutting.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">Coutaz described the technology as \"very seducing\" but noted that a clear way to incorporate it into development workflows is not yet established.</blockquote><p>The announcement also arrives shortly after EA"
