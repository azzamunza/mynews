Recent studies have identified spreading cracks, deteriorating rock from humidity, and fading murals, all of which threaten one of archaeology&apos;s most important discoveries.</p><div class=\"side-image-left\"><img src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/712067/pexels-photo-712067.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800&h=600&dpr=2\" alt=\"Wall paintings inside an Egyptian tomb\"><p>A major fracture running across the ceiling of the burial chamber has allowed rainwater to seep into the structure, dramatically increasing humidity levels. This moisture has accelerated fungal growth on the priceless wall paintings and weakened the tomb&apos;s integrity. The tomb&apos;s construction within unstable Esna shale rock, which expands and contracts with humidity changes, has exacerbated the damage.</p></div><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">&quot;There are current and future risks that will affect the structural integrity of the tomb of Tutankhamun in the long term, and the tomb may not withstand for thousands of years in its current condition.&quot; &mdash; Dr. Sayed Hemeda, Cairo University</blockquote><div class=\"highlight-box info-box\"><h3>Data &amp; Insights</h3><p>A catastrophic flash flood in the Valley of the Kings in 1994 marked a turning point for the tomb&apos;s preservation. The event caused significant water ingress and triggered the fungal growth that continues to damage the murals today. Professor Sayed Hemeda of Cairo University identified this flood as a primary cause of the current structural weaknesses.</p></div><h3>Broader Impact</h3><p>The potential collapse of Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb would be an irreplaceable loss for world heritage. Experts are calling for urgent conservation measures, including stabilising the internal climate and reinforcing the ceiling structure to prevent further deterioration and protect the iconic monument.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h4>Key Takeaways</h4><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb is at serious risk of collapse due to structural damage.</li><li>Key factors include a major ceiling fracture, water infiltration, and humidity.</li><li>The tomb was constructed in unstable Esna shale, making it vulnerable to moisture.</li><li>A major flood in 1994 is cited as a critical event that accelerated the decay.</li></ul></div>"

Detecting the faint signals from this mysterious substance, which is believed to hold galaxies together, has been a major challenge in physics. This new approach could finally make it possible to capture the elusive clues left by dark matter.</p><p>The study centres on superconducting qubits, which are tiny, super-cooled electric circuits typically used in quantum computers.

This rare nuclear process could help explain why the universe is composed primarily of matter. The new technique allows scientists to better filter out distracting background signals from vibrations and other sources.</p><p>With a dataset now double the size of what was previously published, the CUORE collaboration has established new, stringent limits on the occurrence of this decay in tellurium atoms. The findings, published in the journal *Science*, suggest the event happens no more than once every 50 septillion years on average. The experiment uses 988 tellurium dioxide crystals cooled to just 10 millikelvin, making it the coldest cubic meter in the universe.</p><blockquote class=\"expert-quote\">&quot;The focus of this data release is understanding sources of external vibrations and learning how to subtract that from our data to better search for this extremely rare decay,&quot; said Reina Maruyama, U.S. spokesperson for CUORE.</blockquote><p>The new noise-subtraction techniques are not only pivotal for CUORE but could also benefit other highly sensitive detectors, including those used in dark matter and gravitational wave research.

Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling and energy quantization in electrical circuits. This award recognizes a significant achievement in quantum science and technology, aligning with the United Nations&apos; designation of 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.</p><p>Quantum tunneling describes the ability of a particle to pass through a potential energy barrier that it classically should not be able to overcome. The laureates&apos; work demonstrated that this phenomenon is not limited to microscopic particles but can be observed in large systems, or &apos;macroscopic&apos; objects, comprising many thousands of electrons acting as a single entity. Their experiments with ultrathin superconducting wires showed that a whole collection of superconducting electrons could &apos;tunnel&apos; from a state of higher electrical current to a lower one.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">This research provides further evidence that the laws of quantum mechanics continue to govern large systems.</div><p>The historical context for this discovery dates back to the early 20th century with Max Planck&apos;s introduction of energy quantization and Albert Einstein&apos;s explanation of the photoelectric effect, which proposed that light is made of discrete packets of energy called photons. These foundational ideas revolutionised physics and paved the way for understanding the quantum nature of our world, from the bonds holding atoms together to the behaviour of complex materials.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling.</li><li>The winners are John Clarke, Michel H.

This achievement not only improves colour accuracy in artificial lighting but also helps reduce the eye strain and sleep disruption often caused by harsh artificial lights.</p><div class=\"pullquote\">This new design could illuminate the future of phone and computer screens as well as other lighting applications.</div><p>The development team combined expertise in quantum dots with an efficient conductive material design, allowing the ultra-thin white quantum dot LED (QLED) to operate effectively at low voltages. This efficiency makes the technology a viable candidate for future applications in a wide range of electronic devices and general lighting solutions.</p><div class=\"key-takeaways magazine-style\"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul class=\"key-points\"><li>Scientists have created an ultra-thin, paper-like LED using quantum dot technology.</li><li>The LED replicates the full spectrum of natural sunlight, which can reduce eye strain.</li><li>The innovation was achieved by balancing red, yellow-green, and blue quantum dots.</li><li>This technology could transform screens for devices like phones and computers, as well as general home and workplace lighting.</li></ul></div>"
