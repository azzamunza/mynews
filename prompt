In mynews repo, I have a news-data.json file which stores an array of article listings. Part of these listing include html formatted articles for use in a template website. The use of images and YouTube embedded elements are not scaled automatically to fit the containers they are added into. Can you adjust this JSON formatted html articles so that these images and YouTube content fit within the bounds of their parent container they are added into of the template file. The template html can not be adjusted in any way. The template html is the index.html file in the same repo. The data structure of the news-data.json file can not be altered also. Only the html formatted data in each article listings can be adjusted.
